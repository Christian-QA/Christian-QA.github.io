Since then, I've honed my skills as a software engineer, building complex technical solutions for the UK civil service. From implementing new user-facing designs to creating a new caching pattern, I've had the opportunity to deliver excellent results to amazing clients. Now, I'm eager to leverage my full-stack expertise as a freelance polyglot developer with experience in a wide range of frontend, backend and database technologies.",
